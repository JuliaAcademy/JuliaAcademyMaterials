# # Generalized Linear Models
#
# Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a family of statistical models where the prediction
# is based on a function of a linear predictor $x_^T\beta$ where $x$ is a vector of features
# and $\beta$ is the parameter vector.  The two most common GLMs are linear and logistic 
# regression.
