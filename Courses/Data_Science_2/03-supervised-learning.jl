#
# Machine learning is split into two type of tasks, **supervised** and **unsupervised** 
# learning.
#
# - Supervised learning is the family of machine learning tasks that deal with predicting/
#   or classifying an output from an input.
# - Unsupervised learning is the family of machine learning tasks that are used on data
#   that is unlabeled, or does not have an associated output.
