# What is Data Science?

The term **data science** is a relatively new term used to describe a variety of cross-discipline tasks that cover statistics, mathematics, computer science, data visualization, and information science.  Because of the wide variety of tasks involved, the role of a "data scientist" may differ greatly from business to business (or even within a single company).  At a high level, data science is the collection of activities that help one move upword in the [DIKW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid), shown below:

**How do we get from data to knowledge/wisdom?**

Movement up the pyramid happens in incremental steps.  Sometimes you'll have an "aha!" moment and make a leap in understanding, but that is typically due to the previous information you've gathered.  To aid with the task of incremental knowledge-building, the data science workflow is made up of the following steps:

1. Define Your Objective
2. Explore Your Data
3. Model Your Data
4. Explore Your Model
5. Communicate Your Results
