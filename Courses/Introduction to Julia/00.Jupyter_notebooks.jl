# ## Getting started with Jupyter notebooks
#
# ### Running a cell
# To execute code within a cell, select that cell and either (1) hit `Shift` and `Enter` or (2) hit the run button (the right pointing arrow) above.

1 + 1
2 + 2

# If you're new to jupyter notebooks, note that only the last line of a cell prints by default when you execute that cell and that you can suppress this output with a semicolon

1 + 1
2 + 2;

# ### How to get docs for Julia functions
#
# To get docs for a function you're not familiar with, precede it with a question mark. (This works at the REPL too!)

#nb ?println
#jl @doc println

# ### How to use shell commands
#
# Type `;` and then you can use shell commands. For example,

#nb ;ls
#jl run(`ls`)

#-

#nb ;pwd
#jl run(`pwd`)

# Shell commands also work at the REPL!
