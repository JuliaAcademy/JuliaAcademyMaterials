# ## How to print
#
# In Julia we usually use `println()` to print

println("I'm excited to learn Julia!")

# ## How to assign variables
#
# All we need is a variable name, value, and an equal's sign!<br>
# Julia will figure out types for us.

my_answer = 42
typeof(my_answer)

#-

my_pi = 3.14159
typeof(my_pi)

#-

ðŸ˜º = "smiley cat!"
typeof(ðŸ˜º)

# To type a smiley cat, use tab completion to select the emoji name and then tab again

## \:smi + <tab> --> select with down arrow + <enter> ---> <tab> + <enter> to complete

# After assigning a value to a variable, we can reassign a value of a different type to that variable without any issue.

ðŸ˜º = 1

#-

typeof(ðŸ˜º)

# Note: Julia allows us to write super generic code, and ðŸ˜º is an example of this.
#
# This allows us to write code like

ðŸ˜€ = 0
ðŸ˜ž = -1

#-

ðŸ˜º + ðŸ˜ž == ðŸ˜€

# ## How to comment

## You can leave comments on a single line using the pound/hash key

#-

#=

For multi-line comments,
use the '#= =#' sequence.

=#

# ## Syntax for basic math

sum = 3 + 7

#-

difference = 10 - 3

#-

product = 20 * 5

#-

quotient = 100 / 10

#-

power = 10 ^ 2

#-

modulus = 101 % 2

# ### Exercises
#
# #### 1.1
# Look up docs for the `convert` function.

#-

# #### 1.2
# Assign `365` to a variable named `days`. Convert `days` to a float and assign it to variable `days_float`

@assert days == 365
@assert days_float == 365.0

# #### 1.3
# See what happens when you execute
#
# ```julia
# convert(Int64, "1")
# ```
# and
#
# ```julia
# parse(Int64, "1")
# ```
