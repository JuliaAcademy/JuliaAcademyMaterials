# ## How to declare a function
# Julia gives us a few different ways to write a function. The first requires the `function` and `end` keywords

function sayhi(name)
    println("Hi $name, it's great to see you!")
end

#-

function f(x)
    x^2
end

# We can call either of these functions like this:

sayhi("C-3PO")

#-

f(42)

# Alternatively, we could have declared either of these functions in a single line

sayhi2(name) = println("Hi $name, it's great to see you!")

#-

f2(x) = x^2

#-

sayhi2("R2D2")

#-

f2(42)

# Finally, we could have declared these as "anonymous" functions

sayhi3 = name -> println("Hi $name, it's great to see you!")

#-

f3 = x -> x^2

#-

sayhi3("Chewbacca")

#-

f3(42)

# ## Duck-typing in Julia
# *"If it quacks like a duck, it's a duck."* <br><br>
# Julia functions will just work on whatever inputs make sense. <br><br>
# For example, `sayhi` works on the name of this minor tv character, written as an integer...

sayhi(55595472)

# And `f` will work on a matrix. 

A = rand(3, 3)
A

#-

f(A)

# `f` will also work on a string like "hi" because `*` is defined for string inputs as string concatenation.

f("hi")

# On the other hand, `f` will not work on a vector. Unlike `A^2`, which is well-defined, the meaning of `v^2` for a vector, `v`, is not a well-defined algebraic operation. 

v = rand(3)

#-

f(v)

# ## Mutating vs. non-mutating functions
#
# As we mentioned before, the convention is that functions followed by `!` alter their contents and functions lacking `!` do not.
#
# For example, let's look at the difference between `sort` and `sort!`.


v = [3, 5, 2]

#-

sort(v)

#-

v

# `sort(v)` returns a sorted array that contains the same elements as `v`, but `v` is left unchanged. <br><br>
#
# On the other hand, when we run `sort!(v)`, the contents of v are sorted within the array `v`.

sort!(v)

#-

v

# ## Changing names vs. mutation
#
# Recall that variable assignments is just a naming game. Now consider this attempt at a mutating function:

function setzero!(x)
    x = 0
    return x
end
y = 1

# Do you think this will be able to set `y` to zero? Try it:

setzero!(y)

#-

y

# `y` is just a name for the number `1`, and so was `x` inside the `setzero!` function until we decided it would be better served as a name for `0`! So this function doesn't do any mutation at all — it just returns a `0`. If we want to actually mutate the argument, we need to use indexed assignment (or use a real `!` function that actually does what it claims to do). We also need to use a _mutable_ value as the argument — like an array.

function setzero!(x)
    x[1] = 0
    return x
end
y = [1]

#-

setzero!(y)
y

# ## Some higher order functions
#
# ### map
#
# `map` is a "higher-order" function in Julia that *takes a function* as one of its input arguments. 
# `map` then applies that function to every element of the data structure you pass it. For example, executing
#
# ```julia
# map(f, [1, 2, 3])
# ```
# will give you an output array where the function `f` has been applied to all elements of `[1, 2, 3]`
# ```julia
# [f(1), f(2), f(3)]
# ```

map(f, [1, 2, 3])

# Here we've squared all the elements of the vector `[1, 2, 3]`, rather than squaring the vector `[1, 2, 3]`.
#
# To do this, we could have passed to `map` an anonymous function rather than a named function, such as

x -> x^3

# via

map(x -> x^3, [1, 2, 3])

# and now we've cubed all the elements of `[1, 2, 3]`!

#-

# ### broadcast
#
# `broadcast` is another higher-order function like `map`. `broadcast` is a generalization of `map`, so it can do every thing `map` can do and more. The syntax for calling `broadcast` is the same as for calling `map`

broadcast(f, [1, 2, 3])

# and again, we've applied `f` (squared) to all the elements of `[1, 2, 3]` - this time by "broadcasting" `f`!
#
# Some syntactic sugar for calling `broadcast` is to place a `.` between the name of the function you want to `broadcast` and its input arguments. For example,
#
# ```julia
# broadcast(f, [1, 2, 3])
# ```
# is the same as
# ```julia
# f.([1, 2, 3])
# ```

f.([1, 2, 3])

# Notice again how different this is from calling 
# ```julia
# f([1, 2, 3])
# ```
# We can square every element of a vector, but we can't square a vector!

#-

# To drive home the point, let's look at the difference between
#
# ```julia
# f(A)
# ```
# and
# ```julia
# f.(A)
# ```
# for a matrix `A`:

A = [i + 3*j for j in 0:2, i in 1:3]

#-

f(A)

# As before we see that for a matrix, `A`,
# ```
# f(A) = A^2 = A * A
# ``` 
#
# On the other hand,

B = f.(A)

# contains the squares of all the entries of `A`.
#
# This dot syntax for broadcasting allows us to write relatively complex compound elementwise expressions in a way that looks natural/closer to mathematical notation. For example, we can write

A .+ 2 .* f.(A) ./ A

# instead of

broadcast(x -> x + 2 * f(x) / x, A)

# and the two will perform exactly the same.

# ### Exercises
#
# #### 6.1 
# Write a function `add_one` that adds 1 to its input.

@assert add_one(1) == 2

#-

@assert add_one(11) == 12

# #### 6.2 
# Use `map` or `broadcast` to increment every element of matrix `A` by `1` and assign it to a variable `A1`.



# #### 6.3 
# Use the broadcast dot syntax to increment every element of matrix `A1` by `1` and store it in variable `A2`



#-

@assert A2 == [3 4 5; 6 7 8;9 10 11]
