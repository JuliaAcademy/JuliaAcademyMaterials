# # Multiple dispatch

#-

# **Multiple dispatch** is a key feature of Julia, that we will explore in this notebook.
#
# It helps make software fast. It also makes software extensible, programmable, and downright fun to play with.
#
# It may just herald a breakthrough for parallel computation.

# ## 1. Roman numerals (for fun)

#-

# Let's define a **new struct** that represents a Roman numeral. For coding simplicity, we'll just deal with numbers between 0 and 9.
#
# **Exercise**: Extend this to larger numbers. (Recall that Roman numbers are a base-10 system!)

struct Roman
    n::Int
end

Base.show(io::IO, r::Roman) = print(io, 'â…°' + (r.n - 1) % 10 )  # nice display; 'â…°' is a Unicode Roman numeral

# We can create an object of this type as follows:

Roman(4)

#-

typeof.([5 5.0 Roman(5) "Five" '5'  5//1])

# We would like to display it nicely, in Roman numerals:

x = [7 1 2 5 8 9]
Roman.(x)   # equivalent to map(Roman, x)  or  [Roman(w) for w in x]

# It'd be nice to be able to add Roman numerals together like normal numbers:

Roman(4) + Roman(5)

# But Julia doesn't know how to do that. Let's teach it by `import`ing the `+` function, which then allows us to _extend_ its definition:

import Base: +, *

+(a::Roman, b::Roman) = Roman(a.n + b.n)

#-

Roman(4) + Roman(5)

# This **adds a new method** to the function `+`:

methods(+)

#-

import Base.*
*(i::Roman, j::Roman) = Roman(i.n * j.n)                     # Multiply like a Roman

#-

Roman(3) * Roman(2)

#-

Roman.(1:3) .* [Roman(1) Roman(2) Roman(3)]

# But

Roman(3) * 2

## Complicated mytimes to decide what to do based on type
## not suggested, better way coming soon
function mytimes(i,j)
  if isa(i,Roman) & isa(j,Number)
        return  fill(1, i.n, j)   # i by j matrix with ones
    elseif    isa(i,Number) & isa(j,Roman)
        return "ðŸ˜„"^ (i*j.n)   #  i * j happy faces
    else
        return("I Don't know")
    end
end

#-

mytimes(4,Roman(3)) # Twelve happys

#-

mytimes(Roman(4),3) # 4x3 matrix with ones

# The simplest thing to do is to explicitly define multiplication of a `Roman` by a number. We can do it as we see fit:

*(i::Number, j::Roman) = "ðŸ˜„"^ (i*j.n)        #  i * j happy faces

*(i::Roman, j::Number) =   fill(1, i.n, j)       # i by j matrix

#-

3 * Roman(3) # Nine happys

#-

Roman(3) * 5  # Three by Five matrix of ones

#-

t(x::Roman,y::Roman) = x.n * y.n

#-

t(Roman(5),Roman(4))

#-

##  Notice how tight the assembler is!
@code_native t(Roman(2),Roman(4))

# ## Functions

import Base: *, +, ^

#-

*(Î±::Number,   g::Function) = x -> Î± * g(x)   # Scalar times function

*(f::Function, Î»::Number)   = x -> f(Î» * x)   # Scale the argument

*(f::Function, g::Function) = x -> f(g(x))    # Function composition  -- abuse of notation!  use \circ in Julia 0.6

^(f::Function, n::Integer) = n == 1 ? f : f*f^(n-1) # A naive exponentiation algorithm by recursive multiplication

#-

+(f::Function, g::Function) = x -> f(x) + g(x)

# For example, the exponential function is defined as
#
# $$\exp(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} x^n.$$
#
# We can think of this just in terms of functions:
#
# $$\exp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} \mathrm{pow}_n,$$
#
# where $\mathrm{pow}_n(x) = x^n$.
#
# (starts to blur the symbolic with the numerical!)

pow(n) = x -> x^n

myexp = sum(1/factorial(big(n)) * pow(n) for n in 0:100)   # taylor series not efficient!

#-

[myexp(1); exp(1); exp(big(1))]

#-

f = x -> x^2
f(10)

#-

g = 3f
g(10)

#-

(f^2)(10)  # since we defined multiplication of functions as composition

# ###  "Sin^2 phi is odious to me, even though Laplace made use of it; should  it be feared that sin^2 phi might become ambiguous, which would perhaps  never occur, or at most very rarely when speaking of sin(phi^2), well  then, let us write (sin phi)^2, but not sin^2 phi, which by analogy  should signify sin(sin phi)." -- Gauss
