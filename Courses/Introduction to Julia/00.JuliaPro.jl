# ## Getting started with JuliaPro
#
# JuliaPro is a convenient way to view, edit, and display interactive code.
#
# # Executing code
# To execute a line of Julia code, place your cursor on that line and
# and either (1) hit `Shift` and `Enter` or (2) go to the Julia menu and select "Run Block"

2 + 2

# Note that the output appears to the right of the line. If the line ends in a
# semicolon the output is hidden and a simple checkmark notes that you've run the line.

# ## Using the interactive REPL
#
# You can also execute code from within the interactive REPL, which appears
# at the bottom of the window. Note that a number of special modes are available
# at the REPL
