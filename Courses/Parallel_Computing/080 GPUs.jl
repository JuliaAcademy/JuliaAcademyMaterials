# # GPUs
#
# The graphics processor in your computer is _itself_ like a mini-computer highly
# tailored for massively and embarassingly parallel operations (like computing how light will bounce
# off of every point on a 3D mesh of triangles).
#
# Of course, recently their utility in other applications has become more clear
# and thus the GPGPU was born.
#
# Just like how we needed to send data to other processes, we need to send our
# data to the GPU to do computations there.

# ## Example
#
# The deep learning MNIST example: https://fluxml.ai/experiments/mnist/
#
# This is how it looks on the CPU:
using Flux, Flux.Data.MNIST, Statistics
using Flux: onehotbatch, onecold, crossentropy, throttle
using Base.Iterators: repeated, partition

imgs = MNIST.images()
labels = onehotbatch(MNIST.labels(), 0:9)

# Partition into batches of size 32

train = [(cat(float.(imgs[i])..., dims = 4), labels[:,i])
         for i in partition(1:60_000, 32)]
## Prepare test set (first 1,000 images)
tX = cat(float.(MNIST.images(:test)[1:1000])..., dims = 4)
tY = onehotbatch(MNIST.labels(:test)[1:1000], 0:9)

m = Chain(
        Conv((3, 3), 1=>32, relu),
        Conv((3, 3), 32=>32, relu),
        x -> maxpool(x, (2,2)),
        Conv((3, 3), 32=>16, relu),
        x -> maxpool(x, (2,2)),
        Conv((3, 3), 16=>10, relu),
        x -> reshape(x, :, size(x, 4)),
        Dense(90, 10), softmax)

loss(x, y) = crossentropy(m(x), y)
accuracy(x, y) = mean(onecold(m(x)) .== onecold(y))
opt = ADAM()
@time Flux.train!(loss, Flux.params(m), train[1:10], opt, cb = () -> @show(accuracy(tX, tY)))

# Now let's re-do it on a GPU. "All" it takes is moving the data there with `gpu`!
using CuArrays

gputrain = gpu.(train[1:10])
gpum = gpu(m)
gputX = gpu(tX)
gputY = gpu(tY)
gpuloss(x, y) = crossentropy(gpum(x), y)
gpuaccuracy(x, y) = mean(onecold(gpum(x)) .== onecold(y))
@time Flux.train!(gpuloss, Flux.params(gpum), gputrain, opt, cb = () -> @show(gpuaccuracy(gputX, gputY)))

# ## Defining your own GPU kernels
#
# So that's leveraging Flux's ability to work with GPU arrays — which is magical
# and awesome — but you don't always have a library to lean on like that.
# How might you define your own GPU kernel?
#
# Recall the monte carlo pi example:
#
function serialpi(n)
    inside = 0
    for i in 1:n
        x, y = rand(), rand()
        inside += (x^2 + y^2 <= 1)
    end
    return 4 * inside / n
end
#
# How could we express this on the GPU?

using CuArrays.CURAND
function findpi_gpu(n)
    4 * sum(curand(Float64, n).^2 .+ curand(Float64, n).^2 .<= 1) / n
end
findpi_gpu(10_000_000)
#-
using BenchmarkTools
@btime findpi_gpu(10_000_000)
@btime serialpi(10_000_000)

# That leans on broadcast to build the GPU kernel — and is creating three arrays
# in the process — but it's still much faster than our serial pi from before.
#
# We can do even better with a bit more laziness
using FillArrays
function findpi_gpu_lazy(n)
    4 * sum(Fill(0.0, n) .+ curand(Float64).^2 .+ curand(Float64).^2 .<= 1.0) / n
end
@btime findpi_gpu_lazy(10_000_000)

# In general, using CuArrays and broadcast is one of the best ways to just
# get everything to work. If you really want to get your hands dirty, you
# can use [CUDAnative.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDAnative.jl) to manually specify exactly how everything works,
# but be forewarned, it's not for the [faint at heart](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDAnative.jl/blob/master/examples/reduce/reduce.jl)! (If you've done CUDA
# programming in C or C++, it's very similar.)
