# # Fast serial programming with Julia
#
# Yes, this is a parallel computing course â€” but first we must learn how to
# write fast serial Julia code. While there are many additional

Key things to introduce:
* Memory layout and access time
* Types
* Type stability
* Specialization and IR

# ## Julia looks like Python (or your favorite language), how is it faster?

# * Julia can reason about types


# ## Memory movement


# ## Not doing any work at all


# ## Leaning on BLAS
