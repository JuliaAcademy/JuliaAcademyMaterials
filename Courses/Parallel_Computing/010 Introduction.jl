# ## What is happening to our computers!?
#
# ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaAcademyData.jl/master/courses/Parallel_Computing/images/40-years-processor-trend.png)
#
# Not only have we gained multiple cores, but processors have become extremely
# complex, with multiple levels of caches, pipelines, predictions, speculations...
#
# ## What is hard about parallel computing
#   * We don't think in parallel
#   * We learn to write and reason about programs serially
#   * The desire for parallelism often comes _after_ you've written your algorithm (and found it too slow!)
#
# ## Summary:
#   * Current computer archetectures push us towards parallel programming for peak performance â€” even if we're not on a cluster!
#   * But it's hard to design good parallel algorithms
#   * And it's hard to express and reason about those algorithms
