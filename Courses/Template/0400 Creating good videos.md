# Creating good videos

This needs to be expanded, but a few tips and tricks:

* Of course, your content is the most important part. That's what is taking
  center stage here.

* That means that good audio is extremely important! Make sure you have a good
  mic (don't use the builtin mic!) with no or limited background noises and
  practice what you'll say. It's fine to read from a script.

* Background and lighting are the next most important. The easiest thing is to
  just arrange yourself in front of a blank wall, but a clean office can do
  just fine, too. You'll find the best results if you can use natural light
  from a window, but it's not a biggie. Try to look directly into the camera
  when you can.

To perform a screencast on a Mac with your video in a corner, you can just use
Quicktime. It's not immediately obvious how, though â€” [this youtube video shows
you how to set it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQpYMBMWs7g).
