# # The tutorial notebook
#
# We'll often have screencasts walking through a notebook, encouraging
# interactive experimentation. These notebooks are created from source .jl files
# which get automatically converted to ipynb files with Literate.jl and uploaded
# to Juliabox.
# 
# TODO: let's establish rough conventions on the layout of these notebooks.
# * Tell us what you're going to teach.
# * Teach it.
# * Tell us what you taught.
