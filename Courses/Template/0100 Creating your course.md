# About this course

Learn how to create your very own JuliaAcademy course materials (this is the course's tagline).

## Course overview

The first file in your course isn't really a module in your course â€” it's what
will appear in the course overview page. Use this file to simply describe what
students will learn by taking this course. In this case, you will learn how to
develop your very own course.

Talk a little bit about what you expect students to learn and sell them on
taking the course. By the end of this course, you will have learned all the
tools necessary to create your own JuliaAcademy course.

This particular file, as you'll note, is a `md` file. That allows us to avoid
launching a full JuliaBox notebook in cases where it's not necessary. You'll
also note that the name of this file begins with a number and is the very first
such file in this directory. This is the order in which your course curriculum
will be displayed. The lecture titles will be taken directly from the file
names, so name them well.

I think it may be helpful to explicitly list each lecture within the course to
help tell people what you're going to tell them right up front:

* **The `project.toml` file**: Learn how to put your course's metadata into a
  machine-readable file for us to use when we upload it.
* **Creating good videos**: Tips and tricks to help make your videos look, feel,
  and sound professional.
* **The tutorial notebook**
* **The exercise notebook**
* **Conclusion**

Following the template here will set your course up to be professionally styled
just like all our other courses.
